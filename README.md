# TarakMehta_Language
This project implements a custom programming language called TMKOC inspired by the popular Indian TV show "Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah". The language is built using Lex for lexical analysis and Yacc for parsing. The TMKOC language includes humorous constructs such as characters from the show, variable declarations, arithmetic operations, and more. The language also includes error handling to catch lexical, syntax, semantic, and runtime errors.
# Tools Used
Lex: Tokenizes the source code.
Yacc: Defines the grammar and parses the tokenized code.
C: The project is written in C and uses a C compiler to compile the generated code.
# Installation

Install the required tools: Lex and Yacc (Flex and Bison). You can install them via your system's package manager.
Compile the project using Lex to generate the scanner and Yacc to generate the parser.
Build the project by compiling the generated C files.
Run the compiled program with your desired input file.
